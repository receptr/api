# Introduction

Welcome, this is the API documentation for the Signal app.
The purpose of this project is to document Signal's source code to help make sure this project is secure and accessable for open source collaboration.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate).
Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.
